<h1>Project-2</h1>
<h2>BikeFinder</h2>

<p>
The goal for this app was to create a website that allows a cyclist to search for a bike shop (or bike rental locations) either by his/her current location or at a specific location, view results on a map, then finally inquire about hiring a bike from multiple results within a matter of two to three clicks.
</p>
<p>

The app was built using JavaScript with Node.js on the server side, Express as the framework and Mongoose on a Mongo Database.
</p>
<p>
Google Maps and Places API's were employed strictly on the frontend. EJS templates were used for the footer, header and content pages, and Bootstrap as the front-end-framework. The inquiry and user database was then integrated with the email service provider, Mailchimp's API to manage outgoing inquires and user follow up messaging.

Successfully closing the loop on the user experience, and building an end to end lead generation platform.
